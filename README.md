# business-card

This is a front end project in React from Scrimba's [React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) course. It is a one page digital business card, the info is mine, the picture is from the internet.
The project was built from a Figma design. Aside from basic instructions, e.g. there needs to be 4 components, the project was built with only the help of the Figma layout.
